# Introduction

The data in this dataset was collected with several mobile applications built for monitoring and self management of type 2 diabetes. ?? as part of what study?. All apps included almost the same set of features for data collection but all provided different types of feedback to users. Glucoracle app asked individuals to photograph the meal, provide text description and ingredients, estimate nutritional breakdown of the meal, and capture the blood glucose (BG) before and after the meal. The users received predictions for postmeal BG levels. Platano app v1 allowed users to simply record the meals and the BG levels pre and post meals. Platano app v2 allowed users to record the meals+BGs and for each meal asked if the meal met their nutritional goals. Platano users also were provided with Fitbit tracking device for tracking physical activity and sleep.
All meals collected by he app  were evaluated by a nutritional expert to estimate the number of calories and the nutritional breakdown (grams of protein, fat, carbs, fiber) in the meals. Only Glucoracle app also asked users to estimate the calories and nutritional breakdown of the meals to the best of their abilities.

While all the apps had some different features, the dataset collected exhibits a lot of common sets of fields. The goal for this project is to perform exploratory data visualization of this dataset.
